# Feedback form component

A svelte + vite + typescript app that will eventually be a reusable component for the HT website and apps.

## Try it out

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hathitrust/feedback-form.git
cd feedback-form
npm i
npm run dev
```

Follow the terminal link to the front-end. You will likely also need [node-api-proxy](https://github.com/hathitrust/node-api-proxy) running locally to get this work (for now).
